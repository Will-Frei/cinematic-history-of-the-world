# The Cinematic History of the World

_World History, according to movies and TV shows. So... "World" "History"._

## What?
The Cinematic History of the World is a chronological list of movies and TV shows, arranged by the dates of the events portrayed.

To be included in the list, the media in question should at least give the appearance of attempting to portray real events. Their success in doing so, is not a criterion. üòâ

## Why?
1) It's fun to be able to pick a period in time, and watch a bunch of movies and TV shows that portray it.
2) It's interesting to see which periods and places are heavily portrayed, and which are largely ignored.
3) This repo is beginner-friendly! Add a movie or TV show, fix a typo, make a tiny improvement, and let's get you your first commit. üëç
